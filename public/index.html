      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML. blah blah blah

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h1 style="color: #e94560;">My Daily Garage: The Ultimate Daily Car Guessing Game</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>My Daily Garage</strong>, the premier daily challenge for automotive enthusiasts and car
        spotters alike.
        Every day, we feature a new vehicle from automotive history—ranging from classic muscle cars and vintage
        roadsters to modern supercars and obscure JDM legends.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <li><strong>Guess the Car:</strong> You have 5 attempts to identify the Make, Model, and Year of the daily
          vehicle.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Clues:</strong> Each game starts with a zoomed-in crop of a distinctive feature—a headlight,
          a fender vent, or a wheel arch.</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive Reveals:</strong> With each incorrect guess, the image zooms out, revealing more of the
          car to help you narrow down the answer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why Play My Daily Garage?</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you are studying for a car spotting competition or just love cars, My Daily Garage offers a fun,
        low-pressure way to test your knowledge.

      </p>
      <h3>Sharpen Your Automotive Knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        Can you distinguish a 1969 Camaro from a 1968 based on the side marker lights? Do you know the difference
        between a Porsche 996 and 997 headlight?
        My Daily Garage challenges you to look closer at the details that define automotive design.
